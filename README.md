**`Digital Craftsman`**

I program, grind LeetCode, create on YouTube, and write on X.

I'm a CS sophomore focused on building applications and APIs that enhance data access to better liberate society. I aim to push beyond mediocrity and be in the top 1%. 

I fell for the magnificence of technology during 8th grade and since have had a vision to create something for people and provide opportunities for others. My aim is simple â€“ hustle for the things I desire to achieve, including giving my parents the life of their dreams, never needing to rely on anybody else financially, and to be an example to this generation by leaving a legacy.

I've had quite a few setbacks and still do, but nothing is enough to make me give up. I will become the best and I give my word for it.

Thanks for the read.
